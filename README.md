# Musify---HackSprintv2.0
PS - Web application for a music company to segregate playlists based on different moods (ex. Happy, sad, calm, energetic, etc). Two types of users: Company Representative(Admin) and Business User (End user). Company user can add, modify, classify and delete songs from the system. Business user can search and listen to songs according the mood specified.  Business user can give feedback on the mood based autogenerated playlist. The system should automatically change/add new mood type of that song(s) based on feedback.
